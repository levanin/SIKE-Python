# SIKE in Python
A python implementation of Supersingular Isogeny Key Exchange (SIKE) using the optimized reference algorithms.

A brief foray into the internet indicated that there are no publically available implementations of SIKE in python. This is intended solely for educational purposes. Using the reference library available at https://sike.org for the official implementation.


#TO DO
- Add parameters for SIKEp434, p503, p610, p751
- Optimised isogeny computations using strategies. Currently only naive method is used.
